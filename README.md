# Day by Day

## *Tackle the day to day, day by day.*



Day by Day will facilitate daily user journaling, with a 
particular focus towards mental health related functionalities.
Any individual looking for personal growth, stress-relief, 
or reminders in the form of journaling, will benefit from this service.

My interest in mental health started back in my first degree,
where I volunteered as a supportive listener. My experiences as a volunteer
changed my perspective on mental health, and good mental health related habits.
One of the most valuable tools I gained from this experience, was the ability to break down my problems
into more digestible thoughts. Using various techniques, one is able to get down to the root
of their situation and progress in a healthy manner.

I wanted to provide those same functionalities to other people, in the form of directed journaling.
In this app, people will be able to free form journal, or follow written prompts. For example, one such
prompt might go as follows:

- How are you feeling?
- What is making you feel that way?
- Have you felt that way before?
- What can we do to make you feel slightly better?
- Can you use any techniques that you've used before in this situation?

Etc. (and subject to change)

Via **consistent** use, our users will achieve long term mental stability.
